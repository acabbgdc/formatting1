<p><b>Lorem Ipsum</b> is simply dummy <em>text</em> of the printing and typesetting industry.</p>
<p><i><b>Lorem Ipsum</b> has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the <mark>1500s,</mark> when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.</i></p>
<p>It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the <mark>1960s</mark> with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like <b><del>Aldus PageMaker</del></b> including versions of Lorem Ipsum</p>
